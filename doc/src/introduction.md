# Introduction

Mnemosyne is me experimenting with building a telegram bot for learning Greek. This serves two purposes: it enables me to put off actually *doing* my Greek flashcards, and it enables me to learn more about Azure and serveless computing. Anyway, it's really just a side project, not meant for others to use or anything like that. Nothing to see here, move along.
